# TMA4320 - Introduction to Scientific Computation


This folder contains the three projects in the course TMA4320 Introduction to Scientific Computation from spring 2021 at NTNU. The course consists 
of two equal parts: theoretical and practical/computational. The theoretical part of the course introduces numerical mathematics which the 
scientific computing part is built upon. The latter consists of three compulsory projects originating from physics, biophysics and mathematics.
