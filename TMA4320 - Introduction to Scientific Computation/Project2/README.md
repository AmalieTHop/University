# Project2

This is the second of three projects, and it is closely related to biophysics. In this project we have simulateed one-dimensional (1D) photon propagation and attenuation in matter using Monte Carlo methods. The simulations is then used to study X-ray imaging, and the necessary conditions to get good contrast while considering the absorbed dose. Finally, we have imageed unknown objects, given by 3D arrays of attenuation coefficients. 

The file named Project2Description.pdf contains the description of the the project.

The file named Project2.ipynb is an excact copy of the submitted paper. All the results and plots are visible, so there is no need to run the code to read the project.
