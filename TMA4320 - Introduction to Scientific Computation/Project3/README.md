# Project3

This is the third and last project, and it is closely related to mathematics. In this project we have studied certain characteristics of four numerical methods; Shampine-Bogackis method of order 3, Kuttas method of order 4, Kahans method of order 2 and Störmer-Verlets method of order 2. The characteristics we have studied is order of convergence, conservation of energy and Poincaré map. In all of the cases, we have used the Hénon–Heiles model as our problem. 

The file named Project2Description.pdf contains the description of the the project.

The file named Project2.ipynb is an excact copy of the submitted paper. All the results and plots are visible, so there is no need to run the code to read the project.
