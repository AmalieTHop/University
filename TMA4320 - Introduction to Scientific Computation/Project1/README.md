# Project_1
This is the first of three projects, and it is closely related to physics. In this project, we look at a simplified, one-dimensional model of the ocean, and study how CO<sub>2</sub> is
absorbed at the surface, dissolved in the water, and transported down to greater depths by diffusion. Based on this model we simulate the total absorption of CO<sub>2</sub> in the ocean the next 10 years. 

The file named Project1Description.pdf contains the description of the the project.

The file named Project1.ipynb is the submitted paper, but without the optional testcases described in Appendix A in the project description. Please contct me if you would like to have the original paper, where the testcases is included. All the results and plots are visible, so there is no need to run the code to read the project.
